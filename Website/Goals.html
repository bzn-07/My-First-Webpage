			<h1>Goals of AI</h1>

		<div class="content1">
			
			<h4><u>Reasoning, Problem Solving</u></h4>
				<h5><br>
			ㅤEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.<br>

			<br>ㅤThese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.<br></h5>
			
			<br><br><h6><u>Knowledge representation</u></h6>
				<h7><br>
			ㅤKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering are central to classical AI research. Some "expert systems" attempt to gather explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain.<br>

			<br>ㅤAmong the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); and many other, less well researched domains.<br>

			<br>ㅤA representation of "what exists" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the Web Ontology Language.<br></h7>

			<br><br><h8><u><b>Planning</b></u></h8><br>
				<h9><br>
			ㅤIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them. They need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the utility (or "value") of available choices.<br>

			<br><br><h10><u><b>Learning</b></u></h10><br>
				<h11><br>
			ㅤMachine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,[d] is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.<br>

			<br>ㅤUnsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the inputs first. Supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression, which requires a human to label the input data first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories.<br></h11>

			<br><br><h12><u><b>Natural language processing</b></u></h12><br>
				<h13><br>
			ㅤNatural language processing (NLP) allows machines to read and understand human language.<br>

			<br>ㅤA sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval, text mining, question answering and machine translation. Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text.<br></h13>

			<br><br><h14><u><b>Perception</b></u></h14><br>
				<h15><br>
			ㅤMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world.<br>

			<br>ㅤApplications include speech recognition, facial recognition, and object recognition.<br></h15>	

			<br><br><h16><u><b>Motion and Manipulation</b></u></h16><br>
				<h17><br>
			ㅤAI is heavily used in robotics. Advanced robotic arms and other industrial robots, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage.<br>

			<br>ㅤA modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and map its environment.<br></h17>	

			<br><br><h18><u><b>Social Intelligence</b></u></h18><br>
				<h19><br>
			ㅤAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems which recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human affects.<br>

			<br>ㅤFor example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.<br></h19>
